Total time
45 mins

Serves: 4 to 6
Ingredients
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 medium onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons minced ginger
1 tablespoon mild curry powder (I use this one)
¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, more to taste
1 (28-ounce) can fire roasted diced tomatoes
1 cup dried French green lentils, rinsed and drained
2½ cups water
1 (14-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk
½ teaspoon sea salt, more to taste
Freshly ground black pepper
½ cup diced cilantro
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
Instructions
Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook until soft and lightly browned around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes, reducing the heat to low as needed.
With the heat on low, add the garlic, ginger, curry powder, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.
Add the tomatoes, lentils, water, coconut milk, ½ teaspoon salt, and several grinds of black pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce to a simmer, stirring only occasionally, until the lentils are tender, 25 to 35 minutes. If your soup is too thick, stir in ½ to 1 cup more water to reach your desired consistency.
Stir in the cilantro and lime juice. Season to taste and serve.
Notes
Store leftover soup in the fridge for up to 4 days. If it thickens too much in the fridge, stir in a little water while you reheat it until you reach your desired soup consistency. This soup also freezes well.
